    - For each humor, vs. the median level:
        - One above: -1
        - Two above: -4
        - Three above: -8
        - four
        - One below: -1
        - Two below: -4
        - Three below: -8
        - four
        - same: +2
- Amount
    - +1 point per humor
    - +4 points * the lowest humor (e.g. if you have 2b,2p,2y,1k, you get +4*1).
