# Time

Games are a sequence of rounds.

# Scoring - Four Humors

## Leaderboards

Two of them:

1. Round
2. Game

Your round score is added to your game score at the end of each new round.

# Humor Consumption - Each Round

Every once in a while:

- Gong plays on all phones
- 8s
- Round ends

1-3 humors are taken from each player (same number for each player). This changes their round score!jjgg    gddkjlqpqpq11w222ere3344557u78899001
